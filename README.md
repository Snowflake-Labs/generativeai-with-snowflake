Intro to Generative AI with Snowflake
This repository contains all the code used in the Introduction to Generative AI with Snowaflke course available on Coursera and Linkedin Learning

Note (June 2025):
LLM Functions are now called Cortex AISQL. Your existing code, including the code we use in the course, that calls SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.* functions can still be used. Youâ€™ll also see new functions prefixed with AI_ (e.g., AI_COMPLETE, AI_CLASSIFY), some of which have added capabilities. These new functions under the AI_ namespace are also available in python via snowpark.
